title: DRM Doesn't Work
---

## A Nuisance, At Best.
DRM (Digital Rights Management), is a broad term to typically describe software that prevents unauthorized users from accessing whatever it's meant to be protecting. The problem however, is that it usually doesn't deter pirates from breaking in and stealing the booty as it were. Sometimes, it's even detrimental or invasive to legitimate paying customers. 

I'm not an expert on the topic by any means, but I have noticed a few blunders recently that were noteworthy enough for me to write this post. Particularly with the recent release of DOOM Eternal for the PC. 

The game was released using Bethesda's proprietary game launcher, and was meant to be delivered with software called Denuvo baked into the game executable. I'm going to go ahead and take a guess that Denuvo isn't cheap. They probably take a cut of the games that they protect. The silly thing in this case though, was that Bethesda pushed out the internal developer build of the game that didn't have Denuvo attached to it. Thus releasing a DRM free copy into the wild, effectively giving it away.

Thanks Bethesda!

## If They Weren't Going To Buy It, They Still Aren't.
I'd say there's a couple circumstances when it comes to acquiring games:

### I Just Can't Wait!
These are the customers who typically end up preordering, or buying your game within the first few weeks of it releasing. They are often willing to fork out extra for a deluxe or collector's version of the game. They were the ones who supported your kickstarter and believed in you even when your concept was just a twinkle in your eye!

### Wait & See
The folks who wait to see what the reviews are before making their decision to purchase your game. Maybe watch a YouTube video, or a Twitch stream of someone else playing it to get a better idea of what to expect. 

### Sale or Bundle 
Your game wasn't intriguing enough for these types of people to pick up at regular price, or on it's own. But they just can't pass up a good deal! Sure, you don't make as much, but at least it's something. Don't take it personally though, these people are usually just looking for a good deal more than anything.

### Gifts
Maybe they wanted to play the game, but it wasn't worth spending their own money on it. Hey, at least *someone* bought, right? The gift receiver may not even end up playing it, and they might even re-gift, or trade it for something that they do want. Sorry, it happens.

### Butthurts.
These are the worst of the worst. Worse than Pirates in my opinion. These are the types of people who buy your game on Steam just to leave a negative review, and then refund it out of spite. They weren't ever interested in seeing your creative work. They go out of their way to make sure that you know that they don't like you. They might even threaten you, or your loved ones, just because. 

### Yaaaaar, Shiver Me Timbers!
Now... we arrive at ye' old pirates. These are the people who probably would never, under any circumstances spend money on your game. Even at insanely discounted prices. Not necessarily because you don't deserve money for your creative work, but maybe they object to the way that you decided to release your game. We're seeing a lot of this more and more with the Epic Games Store as of late. 

## No Quarter For Pirate Scum!
So, you don't want people to pirate your games. Why would you? So you dump a bunch of money into something like Denuvo to protect your game! Or you spend a bunch of development time on some inhouse anti-piracy checks. At what cost though? Sure, a few opportunistic people who would've pirated the game will now buy it. 

For the most part though, it seems like modern software pirates are just either people too poor to afford your product, or people who would never, under any circumstances, ever, for any reason, whatsoever, buy your game (or software... yes that was a reference to The Office US). 

In a worst case scenario, the DRM you use ends up actually negatively impacting the legitimate paying customers. There have been reports that Monster Hunter World for the PC is just an absolute abysmal experience due to it's anti-piracy and anti-cheat software. Severe performance hits. 

Or maybe your game uses an "Always Online" feature to make sure that you don't distribute the game to a friend and allow them to play it offline, for instance. What happens if your authentication server goes down, or your company goes under, and the game is just no longer playable? 

Regardless, the main problem with all of these things is *they just don't work*. Nearly without exception, all DRM is eventually broken. Very few cases end up taking longer than a few weeks to crack. Licenses checks are bypassed. Always online checks are spoofed using host DNS modifications. Heartbeats use host mods and emulators. The only real way to prevent DRM from being broken is to use something like cloud computing, and never give users the files to begin with. Go back to terminal computing. We're seeing a trend towards that a bit now, and I don't like it, personally. 

## So, Is It Worth It?
Again, I'm no expert, or analyst. It just seems like there's a lot of effort going into making sure that people aren't stealing games. However, with so many games competing for your attention, even if you were giving it out for free, the chances are that people still won't play it. Personally, I find myself less likely to play a game if it requires some sort of obnoxious DRM check. It's the reason I refuse to play anything from the Epic Games Store. 

For a long time I refused to buy anything on Steam because I hated that I had to launch software just to a launch the game that I wanted to play. It wasn't until Steam evolved to be more than a DRM check/storefront, and started including things like achievements that I became less opposed to using it.

There are nice DRM free versions of games that people **do buy though**! Look no further than GOG! They sell DRM free versions of a lot of games out there. I think this is evidence that as long as you make it easy to purchase and play your game, there are tons of people who will legitimately pay for it. 

## The Irony of DOOM Eternal.
The only reason that this DRM free version of DOOM Eternal made it's way to the internet is because of DRM. Bethesda uses their own platform launcher to serve updates to their games, and for some baffling reason, they require you to connect to the internet with an account to play DOOM Eternal, a singleplayer only campaign game.

I'm not saying that by using only Steam (more DRM), that they would've avoided serving the Denuvo free version of the game... But they probably would've double checked it at the very least.

This post is long, and likely won't be seen by anyone. So I'll leave it at that. If you do happen to read this, thanks! I just don't really think DRM works as well as developers and publishers seem to. Their efforts amount to time wasted on things that could've went to acutal game development.
