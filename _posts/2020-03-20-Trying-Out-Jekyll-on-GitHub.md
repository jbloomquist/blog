title: Trying out Jekyll on GitHub!

### What is Jekyll?
Jekyll is a pretty cool, blog-friendly content-aware, static site generator that takes advantage of Ruby to serve not only fast, but efficient websites without the need for a database to dynamically serve content. It takes advantage of config files to handle templates and serve your content with Front Matter, and supports Markdown making it really easy to handle publishing things like this blog post!

### So why Jekyll?
So the previous paragraph didn't sell you on it? *Okay*. 

Here's my shortlist of reasons why I prefer Jekyll to some of the alternatives out there:

1. It's fast. 
2. Easy to deploy. 
3. Free to use, and host. 
5. Only does what you tell it to do. 

Let's address those reasons in order.

##### Speed
I've worked on a few websites that utilized WordPress as it's CMS, and while it's robust and offers a lot of customizations through plugins... It can be painfully slow. Bloated, unoptimized user-scripts and plugins can increase page-load by a not insignificant amount of time, especially for users who don't have a fast, modern internet connection. It just isn't ideal for what I want out of a blog. 

##### Deployment
There are some easy to deploy publishing systems out there, but it's hard to beat forking a working deployment on GitHub and just have things work. I don't have to hop into SSH or mess with FTP. It's just all there, and it works. *It just works*! 

##### Cost
No licensing fees to unlock additional features, and you can instantly get up-and-running for free using GitHub Pages. I don't have to worry about potential server migration messing up the deployment, and I can save a few extra dollars per month. 

##### Explicit
This is the best part in my opinion. I don't have to worry about extra scripts, or weird query functions. It only does **EXACTLY** what I tell it to do. Load this content, here, now. That's it. Elegant, and simple.

### Let's see where this goes...
I'm not making any promises that this will be a thing that I focus any significant amount of my attention on. But I'd like to have it here for when I do have a thought about something that deserves more than a single tweet's character limit. 

Honestly though, Jekyll is pretty cool.
